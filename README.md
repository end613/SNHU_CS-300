Data Structures and Algorithms

The course projects required me to create an advising assistance program which would read and store and organize course data for the Computer Science curriculum. The main task involved determining and implementing the most suitable data structure to handle information storage and retrieval functions so users could access courses and prerequisites and print schedules in alphabetical order. The core elements of software efficiency depend on data structures so it was essential to learn about them for creating a reliable and efficient program. I resolved the problem by evaluating multiple options based on runtime and memory trade-offs before selecting a binary search tree which provided both efficient lookup capabilities and natural in-order sorting. The experience demonstrated how data structures serve as essential programming elements because appropriate selection simplifies both design development and user interface creation.

The process involved dealing with file handling issues and exact menu and output specification compliance through stepwise problem breakdown and sample output review and iterative testing until results met expectations. The experience taught me to develop maintainable code through functions that separate tasks and use inline comments and standard naming conventions. The projects have modified my software design approach by making readability and adaptability equal to program functionality. My code structure now reflects both functional capabilities and sustainability because I think about user and developer interactions which will benefit future real-world projects.
